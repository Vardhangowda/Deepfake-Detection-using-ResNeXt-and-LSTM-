# DeepFake Detection
This project detects deepfake videos using a hybrid deep learning model combining ResNeXt for spatial feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence learning.
Video frames are extracted and preprocessed using OpenCV to analyze facial inconsistencies.
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Models: ResNeXt-50 CNN, LSTM (RNN), Binary Classifier
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git, GitHub
Test Results: Achieved 94–96% accuracy, 93% precision, 94% recall, and 94% F1-score on the test dataset.
The system demonstrates reliable performance on benchmark deepfake datasets.
